<p>As you may have seen on the homepage, I'm <span itemprop="name">Tim Millwood</span>.<p>
<p>Since leaving University in 2007 I have been working with <a href="http://www.drupal.org">Drupal</a>, building sites at <a href="http://www.ibo.org">The International Baccalaureate</a> and <a href="http://www.markboultondesign.com">Mark Boulton Design</a>. Now working as a <span itemprop="title">Client Advisor</span> at <a href="http://www.acquia.com" itemprop="affiliation">Acquia</a> I help get sites set up and launched on Acquia's Managed Cloud hosting platform.

<p>I maintain Drupal modules and themes as well as being the Drupal core maintainer for the Statistics module. Outside of Drupal it's fun to play with other languages and frameworks, which is why this site is built in <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a> using <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">Sinatra</a></p>
